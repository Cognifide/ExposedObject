Fast dynamic wrapper for accessing hidden methods and fields of .Net objects.

EXAMPLES:

Accessing private method on a visible type:
	dynamic exposed = Exposed.From(new ClassWithHiddenMethods());
	string password = exposed.GeneratePassword(8);

Accessing private field on a hidden type:
	dynamic exposed = Exposed.New(Type.GetType("TestSubjects.HiddenClass, TestSubjects"));
    string password = exposed.password;

Accessing internal static method of a hidden type:
	dynamic exposed = Exposed.From(Type.GetType("TestSubjects.StaticClass, TestSubjects"));
	decimal convertValue = exposed.ConvertValue(8);

TODO:
- performance assessment (binding restrictions vs caching, compare with CreateDelegate solution)
- generic methods
- constructors
